# The current phenomenon of AI

It seems that most of the software and services are urgently creates a need of
AI in the year of 2025. My experience with AI is far from what is marketed.
There are smart and dumber AI, but even the smartest AI is not capable of
replacing a collage student or maybe high school student even AI companies are
calming that developers will be replaced by AI. Beyond the technology world, AI
is not widely used as shown on OpenRouter.

## The stupidity of AI hype

From my experience, AI is not capable of doing anything that a human can do.
ChatGPT o3, Claude sonnet 4, Grok, Gemini 2.5 pro, DeepSeek r1, v3, and others
wrote code in a overly complex way, and it is not always clear why it does so.
It make mistake such as premature optimization, premature abstraction, and
repetitive code. They all makes mistakes with confidence. To avoid this, the
effective way to further splitting the task to a level a high school student
who learns programming can understand.

The advantage of AI in 2025 is to be able to read files much much faster than
any human; do repetitive tasks such as writing boilerplate code, change file
names across multiple directories; generate code snippets that already has
answers.

It's ability to interpret is limited by its context window. However, if given
the same context windows as a human's 10 years life experience, can it solve a
new problem.

## AI model loyalty

No loyalty use which ever is cheaper.

## experience during DailyRepo

AI work has advantages, speed, anything that already has a answer for
however, a lot of programming problems already has answers

Replace low skill developers who refused to use AI

What AI is not capable of doing:

1. expression and programming taste
2. decision making: involve real money and liability
3. Large complex system.

## Supervising

Microsoft claims that AI has better accuracy in diagnostic than even the top
radiologists. But if that AI makes a mistake, who is responsible? The AI
company, the hospital, or the radiologist? It is similar to AI judges, who is
responsible if the AI judge makes a mistake?

The maximum punishment for AI in this case is to turn it off or subscribe.
What's the point of putting AI behind bars?

If AI write bad or buggy code, who is responsible? From my experience, AI often
write suboptimal code, and it is not always clear why it does so.

## People vs People

Every problem eventually comes down to people. When Uber comes to a city, it is
not taxi and Uber cars having problems, it is the people who drive them.

## New humans

As new borns are surrounded by AI, critical thinking is so important like never
before. AI makes it easy to give up brain powers. When most of the answers are
easy to obtain, where is the experience of thinking?
