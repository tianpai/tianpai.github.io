## About Me

Recent Computer Science graduate from University of Toronto currently in an
intentional exploration phase. Rather than locking into a specific tech stack
early, I'm sampling different web development technologies broadly. I believe
you need to try as much as possible before choosing an area to specialize and
truly polish your expertise in.

I treat software engineering like any other engineering discipline: identify
the problem first, understand requirements deeply, develop high-level tactics,
then experiment with proof-of-concepts and iterate. This methodical process
drives everything I build, from stable development pipelines to experimental
CLI tools.

I'm focused on building tools that change how people relate to technology, not
just adding more features to the world. Every project needs intentional design
language and taste, something that stands out from generic solutions you'd find
anywhere else. I don't want to create something generic that blends into the
app store crowd. My projects tend to solve problems I actually face, with
thoughtful consideration of how users interact with their tools. Currently
drawn to backend and app development, always thinking about the intersection of
technical implementation and human experience, while constantly learning
through books like API design patterns.

My recent project dailyrepo now has a stable development pipeline, making
feature management seamless. I'm exploring proof-of-concepts including a
reminder app that fades away if forgotten, encouraging internal motivation over
external dependency, and pimp, a personal infrastructure management CLI in Go
for instant configuration switching and community config sharing. Always
building with the goal of changing how people interact with their development
tools.
