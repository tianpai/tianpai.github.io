Welcome to the home for everything I'm building lately. After years of trying
to force a JavaScript stack into every project, I wanted a quieter space that
puts writing and shipping ahead of tooling.

Most days I'm designing and coding small, full-stack projects that connect data,
automation, and product thinking. Sometimes that means scraping, sometimes it is
about shipping a cleaned-up workflow for myself or for friends.

This site now tracks what I'm learning, ships the build logs that survive the
editing pass, and keeps links to the current projects in one place.
